# Challenge-15-MechaCar_Statistical_Analysis

##Overview
We are part of the data analytics team at AutosRUs. Upper Management needs some help with details on a special project. They need some analysis work done on the new prototype for their MechaCar. We have been asked to gather and deliver the following information:
  - Deliverable 1: Linear Regression to Predict MPG
  - Deliverable 2: Summary Statistics on Suspension Coils
  - Deliverable 3: T-Test on Suspension Coils
  - Deliverable 4: Design a Study Comparing the MechaCar to the Competition

  ## Linear Regression to Predict MPG


![Deliverable 1](https://github.com/LindsayTeeters/Challenge-15-MechaCar_Statistical_Analysis/blob/main/Resources/summary%20mpg%20vehicle%20lengthwidth.png)


Addressed Questions:

<b><I>1. Which variables/coefficients provided a non-random amount of variance to the mpg values in the dataset?</I></b>
The ground clearance and vehicle length both would greatly affect miles per gallon. These two are non-random variables when considering mpg.

<b><I>2. Is the slope of the linear model considered to be zero? Why or why not?</I></b>
The slope of this linear model is not 0. The p-value is 5.35. Some of the variables drastically impact the miles per gallon of the vehicle.

<b><I>Does this linear model predict mpg of MechaCar prototypes effectively? Why or why not?</I></b>
Although its not 100%, this linear model is a good model to predict miles per gallon (mpg) or the MechCar prototupe. The R-squared is 0.7149, which is an adequate level to base the predicitons off of.
